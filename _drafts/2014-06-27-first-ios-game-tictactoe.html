<p>Here's a look at how my first iOS game -- an implementation of Tic Tac Toe -- was made.</p>
<p>This project started with the following under my belt:</p>
<ul>
<li>I had already implemented Tic Tac Toe in C#</li>
<li>I already had basic knowledge of Objective-C, SpriteBuilder, and Xcode</li>
<li>I had worked through a tutorial demonstrating how to implement 2048</li>
</ul>
<p>With that, I dove in!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm in the process of establishing my workflow for producing games, but it is loosely as follows:</p>
<p>- create GitHub repository and local workspace (e.g. create empty repo on GitHub and clone it to your system)<br />
- get assets together - these can be placeholders (e.g. for TicTacToe, I used an image of an X and an O)<br />
- create CCBs in SpriteBuilder (e.g. Grid, Player 1 label, Player 2 label, Score, Quit button)<br />
- assign code connections appropriately (i.e. when is a class needed? when are instance variables needed?)<br />
- create logic in code without thinking of user interaction (i.e. what should be loaded?)<br />
- work on user interaction<br />
- work on scoring</p>
<h2>Setting Up in SpriteBuilder</h2>
<p>Before starting in SpriteBuilder, I made sure I had a folder (that I called <em>TicTacToeAssets</em>) ready with the graphics I planned to use for the X and the O pieces.</p>
<ul>
<li>
Created new SpriteBuilder project called <em>TicTacToe</em>
</li>
<li>
Removed default 'SpriteBuilder' text for new projects
</li>
<li>
Added a holding place for the 3x3 board (Tiles to be generated in code)</p>
<ul>
<li>Anchor point: (0.5, 0.5)</li>
<li>Position: should be (50, 50) in percentage of parent container</li>
<li>Content size: (300,300)</li>
<li>Color: your choice</li>
</ul>
<p>
</li>
<li>
Created a code connection with a Class called <em>Board</em> and an instance variable called <em>_board</em>
</li>
<li>
Created a CCLayoutBox to hold the Players Scores, Round Number, and Restart button
</li>
<li>
Created LabelTTF Nodes for the <em>Player 1</em>, <em>Player 2</em>, <em>Player 1 score (set text to 0)</em>, and <em>Player 2 score</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Font size: 56</li>
<li>Alignment: Center/Center</li>
</ul>
<p>
</li>
<li>
Assign instance variables to scores (I called these <em>_player1ScoreLabel</em> and <em>_player2ScoreLabel</em>)
</li>
<li>
Create Button labeled <em>Restart</em>
</li>
<li>
Created code connection for Restart button - Selector = <em>restart</em>, Target = <em>Document root</em>
</li>
<li>
Created labels for the word <em>Round</em> and for the Round Number (set to <em>1</em>)
</li>
<li>
Created code connection for Round num (called it <em>_roundLabel</em>)
</li>
<li>
Order Player Labels, Round Labels, and Restart button in the correct order in the CCLayoutBox (vertical)
</li>
<li>
Add BoardSpot CC Node
</li>
<li>
Create class code connection for BoardSpot
</li>
<li>
Created additional code connections for interface elements that would be updated - Restart button, Round num
</li>
</ul>
<p>And that, loosely, was my initial setup in SpriteBuilder. What that gives me is a much more concrete idea of what my board is going to need to initialize with and what users interacting with it will expect (e.g. Round numbers increase, Retry button wipes out Round Numbers)</p>
<h2>Setting up in Xcode</h2>
<p>Next, I create the class(es) and instance variables I've defined in SpriteBuilder. Initially, you'll get a warning about the instance variables not being used -- that's fine. And, it actually helps in the long run, because you' may realize you created an instance variable you don't need, and you can clean it up in both Xcode and Spritebuilder.</p>
<ul>
<li>
Create the Board class
</li>
<li>
Create the _board, _player1ScoreLabel, _player2ScoreLabel and _roundLabel in MainScene.m
</li>
<li>
Fix Unknown type name 'Board' error by using #import "Board.h"
</li>
<li>
Create BoardSpot class
</li>
<li>
Add BoardSpot instance variables _boardspotLabel and _boardspotColor
</li>
</ul>
<p>You can now run and should see the layout you created in SpriteBuilder!</p>
<h2>Coding!</h2>
<p>We're getting to the meat of it. I'm breaking this down into 3 major steps to getting this functional:</p>
<ol>
<li>Coding the Basics - loading tiles, etc.</li>
<li>Allowing for user interaction</li>
<li>Allowing for scoring and round updating</li>
</ol>
<h3>Coding the Basics</h3>
<p>We need a 3x3 grid - lets add 5px margins between squares.</p>
<ul>
<li>
Add variables to BoardSpot.m to calculate boardspot sizes
</li>
<li>
Write a method (I called this <em>setupBackground</em> that creates boardspots with the correct dimensions
</li>
<li>
Create <em>didLoadFromCCB</em> method to call the setupBackground method when the Board is loaded
</li>
</ul>
