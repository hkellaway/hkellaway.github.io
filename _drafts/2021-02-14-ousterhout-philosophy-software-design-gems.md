Inspired by [It's probably time to stop recommending Clean Code](https://qntm.org/clean). There's a lot of vitriol in this piece and in the [commentary](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23671022) on the post that led me there. There are a lot of valid points made, some are just the natural consequence of practice evolving. Regardless, Clean Code was formative for me as a developer and as a student of software design.
