I’m here to tell you: non-coders can participate in hackathons. I know this because I recently attended a hackathon where there were a handful of non-coders in attendance. I may not have personally taken note of this, except I sensed an uneasiness among the attendees who didn’t code when we started off with an ice-breaker: tell us your name, tell us what you do, tell us why you’re here.</p>
<p>This was juxtaposed against the fact that our very first two presenters — Janet Mock and Sarah Praeger — are distinctly not programmers themselves</p>
<p>Furthermore, hackathons can benefit from those with a variety of specialties.</p>
<p>The first two place prizes both included members who Third place project didn’t require code.</p>
<p>Im taking a broad interpretation of the word ‘hack’ — as in, hack something pertinent together in a short period of time.</p>
<p>Steal these ideas</p>
<p>- create new hashtag – #girlslikeus (#guyslikeus, #folkslikeus, make sure its unique)<br />
- bomb hashtags or versions of hastags (e.g. #MakeoverMondays http://www.slate.com/blogs/future_tense/2013/11/20/manicuremonday_seventeen_magazine_s_hashtag_hijacked_by_scientists.html)<br />
- wikipedia storm<br />
- ‘social media domino’ – Tumblr &gt; Twitter &gt; Facebook/Paper.li<br />
- design a project — e.g. QuistApp, or website takeovers of Victorieas Secret<br />
- utilize already robust tools: HistoryPin<br />
- create a new, unique blog – e.g.</p>
