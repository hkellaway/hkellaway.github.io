1. Act with Prudence by Seb Rose

**TL;DR: Pay off technical debt as soon as possible**

"If you find yourself having to choose between 'doing it riight' and 'doing it quick', it is often appealing to 'do it quick' with the understanding that you'll come back and fix it later...This sort of deferred work is known as *technical debt*...Specifically, Martin Fowler calls *deliberate technical debt*...not [to] be confused with *inadvertent technical debt*...[If] the situation absolutely demands it then go ahead. [But] you must track technical debt and pay it back quickly...Leaving the debt unpaid will accrue interest, and that interest should be track to make the cost visible....The choice of how to calculate and track the interest will depend on the particular project, but track it you must. Pay off technical debt as soon as possible.""

2. Apply Functional Programming Principles by Edward Garson

**TL;DR: Master the functional programming paradigm so you are able to judiciously apply the lessons learned to other domains**

"If you deeply understand and apply the functional paradigm, your designs will exhibit a much higher degree of **referential transparancy**...[which] implie that functions consistently yield the same results given the same input, irrespective of where and when they are invoked...A leading cause in imperative code is attributable to mutable variables...[Functional programming] approach is not optimal in all situations. For example, in object-oriented systems, thi style often yields better results with domain model development (i.e., where collaborations serve to break down the complexity of business rules) than with user-interface development. Master the functional programming paradigm so you are able to judiciously apply the lessons learned to other domains"
