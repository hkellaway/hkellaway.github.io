You would never be able to tell from my bookshelf that I specialize in iOS - everything I read on code is about What Is Good General Practice. To that end, I did a study recently of "[97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/97-things-every/9780596809515/)" (Kevlin Henney for O'Reilly Media, 2010). While I would say it's not the best entry in this category of reading material, I do find the format very effective for proglonged enagement - it remained fun to read a tip or 2 every day over the course of a few months. The following is a distillation of the lessons learned.

# TL;DRs

[1] Pay off technical debt as soon as possible

[2] Master the functional programming paradigm so you are able to judiciously apply the lessons learned to other domains

[3] The best way to capture requirements is to watch users

[4] Coding Standards should be automated and enforced where possible

[5] No matter how complex the total application or system is, the individual parts have to be kept simple

[6] Restructuring will not always guarantee that the new code will be better - or even as good as - the previous attempt

[7] Creating libraries of shared code without context can increase cost rather than value

[8] Always check a module in cleaner than when you checked it out

[9] You are far better putting your time into finding the error in your code than proving others are wrong

[10] Use only the tools - components, libraries, frameworks - that are absolutely necessary

[11] If you don't code using domain terms, you are creating a tacit understanding - better to make it explicit for the next programmer

[12] Great designs are produced by great designers dedicating themselves to the matery of their craft. Code is no different.

[13] We spend much more of our programming time navigating and reading code than actually typing, so that's what we want to optimize for with code layout.

## Further Thoughts & Resources

[1] Act with Prudence by Seb Rose

**TL;DR: Pay off technical debt as soon as possible**

"If you find yourself having to choose between 'doing it right' and 'doing it quick', it is often appealing to 'do it quick' with the understanding that you'll come back and fix it later...This sort of deferred work is known as *technical debt*...Specifically, Martin Fowler calls *deliberate technical debt*...not [to] be confused with *inadvertent technical debt*...[If] the situation absolutely demands it then go ahead. [But] you must track technical debt and pay it back quickly...Leaving the debt unpaid will accrue interest, and that interest should be track to make the cost visible....The choice of how to calculate and track the interest will depend on the particular project, but track it you must. Pay off technical debt as soon as possible.""

[2] Apply Functional Programming Principles by Edward Garson

**TL;DR: Master the functional programming paradigm so you are able to judiciously apply the lessons learned to other domains**

"If you deeply understand and apply the functional paradigm, your designs will exhibit a much higher degree of **referential transparancy**...[which] implie that functions consistently yield the same results given the same input, irrespective of where and when they are invoked...A leading cause in imperative code is attributable to mutable variables...[Functional programming] approach is not optimal in all situations. For example, in object-oriented systems, thi style often yields better results with domain model development (i.e., where collaborations serve to break down the complexity of business rules) than with user-interface development. Master the functional programming paradigm so you are able to judiciously apply the lessons learned to other domains"

[3] Ask "What Would the User Do?" (You Are Not the User) by Giles Colborne

**TL;DR: The best way to capture requirements is to watch users**

[4] Automate Your Coding Standard by Filip van Laenen

**TL;DR: Coding Standards should be automated and enfored where possible**

"[Coding Standards] should be automated and enforced where possible. Here are a few examples: Make sure formatting is part of the build process...Use static code analysis to scan for unwanted antipatterns...break the build if test coverage is too low....As for the things that you can't automatically flag or fix, consider them a set of guidelines supplementary to the coding standard that is automated, but accept that you and your colleagues may not follow them as diligently"

[5] Beauty Is In Simplicity by Jorn Olmheim

**TL;DR: No matter how complex the total application or system is, the individual parts have to be kept simple**

"There are a nuber of things we strive for in our code: Readability, Maintainability, Speed of development, The elusive quality of beauty...the enabling factor for all of these qualities is simplicity...no matter how complex the total application or system is, the individual parts have to be kept simple: simple objects with a simple responsibility containing similarly simple, focused methods with descriptive names"

**TL;DR: Restructuring will not always guarantee that the new code will be better - or even as good as - the previous attempt**
