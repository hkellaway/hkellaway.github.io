<p>Is there such a thing?</p>
<p>I'm here to tell you: there is! <a target="_blank" href="../2013/09/26/top-4-tips-from-transh4ck-2013/">I recently attended a hackathon</a> where non-coders were an important part of the picture. I may not have personally taken note of the wealth in attendance, except I sensed an uneasiness among the attendees who didn't code when we started off with an ice-breaker: tell us your name, tell us what you do, tell us why you're here. </p>
<p>This was juxtaposed against the fact that our very first two presenters -- <a target="_blank" href="http://janetmock.com/2012/05/28/twitter-girlslikeus-campaign-for-trans-women/">Janet Mock</a> and <a target="_blank" href="http://sarahprager.com/2013/08/01/quists-launch/">Sarah Prager</a> -- are distinctly not programmers themselves. How did two non-programmers end up headlining the first hour of a hackathon? How did the first place team end up with non-coders? How did the third place project not have a coder at all??</p>

<p>Everyone has something to bring to the table when a diverse pool of people are to receive the benefits of the hacks produced -- coders do not have monopolies on good ideas or the ability to think of all the ideas or to do all of the things. Granted, it takes a certain kind of hackathon to be able to incorporate non-coders as meaningfully as coders. </p>
<p>Also, a broad interpretation of 'hack'.</p>
<p>Trans*H4CK chose the right style.</p>
<p>I'm taking a broad interpretation of the word 'hack' -- as in, hack <em>something</em> pertinent together in a short period of time.</p>
<h3>Steal these ideas</h3>
<p>- create new hashtag - #girlslikeus (#guyslikeus, #folkslikeus, make sure its unique)<br />
- bomb hashtags or versions of hastags (e.g. #MakeoverMondays http://www.slate.com/blogs/future_tense/2013/11/20/manicuremonday_seventeen_magazine_s_hashtag_hijacked_by_scientists.html, http://www.bilerico.com/2014/01/lgbt_advocates_hijack_mcdonalds_cheerstosochi_camp.php)<br />
- wikipedia storm<br />
- 'social media domino' - Tumblr &gt; Twitter &gt; Facebook/Paper.li<br />
- design a project -- e.g. QuistApp, or website takeovers of Victorieas Secret<br />
- utilize already robust tools: HistoryPin<br />
- create a new, unique blog - e.g. </p>
<p>Furthermore, hackathons can benefit from those with a variety of specialties.</p>
