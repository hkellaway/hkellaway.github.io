<p>-## A Journey to Programming<br />
-<br />
-Every programmer has a different motivation and path for heading towards the craft. When thinking about my own journey, I realized how powerful it might be to hear counter-narratives to the geek-guy turns brilliant engineer/business mind and heads to Silicon Valley that we [hear](http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2007/jul/25/media.newmedia) [so](http://www.forbes.com/sites/jjcolao/2014/01/06/the-inside-story-of-snapchat-the-worlds-hottest-app-or-a-3-billion-disappearing-act/) [often](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-2128518/Instagram-The-nerds-billion-551-days-camera-app.html). Drive-by - I came from a single-parent, mixed-race household dependent on welfare to being a developer in an industry that celebrates what feels like the very opposite of my background.<br />

-### How I Began<br />
-<br />
-<br />
-As mentioned, my journey started very humbly. I am the child of a single parent who had unexpectedly became pregnant at 41 and unexpectedly had triplets and no recourse to raise them but to turn to the welfare system. My mother plugged it into our heads that we needed to get a good education - that this was the way out of poverty. My current politics donâ€™t leave me necessarily convinced that this American-Dream-like narrative is a cure-all - but back in the 90s, when I was growing up, this basic formula still worked fairly well for those with enough privilege (my own being: white-passing, able-bodied, liberal-location dwelling, among others). That being said, it was no walk-in-the-park to get that education. My mother was adamant about her children remaining in a town with a good public education system, despite consequently being limited to the few subsidized apartments controlled by lazy landlords.<br />

-### A Different World<br />

-A lot of my personal story has to do with education. But, today, education - at least in Computer Science - is different and still shifting.<br />
