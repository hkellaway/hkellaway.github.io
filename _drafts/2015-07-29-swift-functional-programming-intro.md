# Introduction

Swift introduces a new paradigm to the world of iOS programming: the functional paradigm. Many of us iOS developers have become so used to Objective-C - and perhaps other object-oriented languages before - that writing and thinking functionally feels a bit brain-addling. 

Where to begin? Myself, I find examples the easiest to digest - and  I thankfully needn't have looked farther than this wonderful post by [Mary Rose Cook](http://maryrosecook.com/) to find some good ones: [
A practical introduction to functional programming](http://maryrosecook.com/blog/post/a-practical-introduction-to-functional-programming). Not only that, but she includes examples of code that you and I might write and the functional complement.

What my post does is revisit Cook's examples, except in Swift. So before you make your way through this, do read her post - not only did it originate these examples, but it has very clear explanations of functional programming concepts for beginners.
