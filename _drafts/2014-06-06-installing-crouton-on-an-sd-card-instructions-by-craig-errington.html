<p>crouton script, from SD card</p>
<p>Updated some of the instructions below</p>
<p>So, I’ve just been shown how to install the XFCE chroot environment onto an SD card.. (I will include instructions for internal and external). These instructions supercede all previous ones, as a lot of fixes are incorperated by the Crouton developer, and are no longer needed.</p>
<p>So now, you can run ChromeOS, a full Ubuntu with an XFCE desktop, literally at the same time, switch between them with a key stroke, and not use up any of the internal storage of your Chromebook…</p>
<p>These instructions are written for the ARM Chromebook – they will work for other devices BUT be very careful and figure out the name of your SD card using “sudo fdisk -l” before following anything below – anywhere you see “/dev/mmcblk1″ you should substitute for your SD card name.</p>
<p>First up, if you’re like me, you’ll want to remove your original chroot, and start again with the SD.</p>
<p>So first command:</p>
<p>1<br />
sudo delete-chroot precise<br />
Making an EXT4 Partition on your SD Card</p>
<p>(ignore this whole section it you want to install internally, I’ll give you a shout when it’s time to join back in!)</p>
<p>This assumes you want to use the whole SD. If you have another computer, instead of using your Chromebook – this can be replaced with “insert SD in computer, make EXT4 partition with gparted”…But this is written with the assumption you’ll be using an ARM chromebook for *all* steps.</p>
<p>Get into a shell</p>
<p>This is destructive to your SD card, kiss its content goodbye (or back it up)</p>
<p>First, we’ll just check the name of our SD card:</p>
<p>1<br />
sudo fdisk -l<br />
On the ARM chromebook it’s /dev/mmcblk1</p>
<p>Next wee’ll unmount any partitions mounted on the SD</p>
<p>1<br />
sudo umount /dev/mmcblk1*<br />
Next we’re going to create a new partition table on the SD card.</p>
<p>1<br />
sudo parted /dev/mmcblk1<br />
This will take you into the ‘parted’ application, where we can create the new table.. Execute the following line and then click enter</p>
<p>1<br />
mktable msdos<br />
Type “yes” when asked and hit return. Then type “quit” and click enter.</p>
<p>Reboot the chromebook to clear the mount points and stuff… (Do it, seriously)</p>
<p>Get back into a shell</p>
<p>Now we’re going to create a linux partition onto the SD card</p>
<p>1<br />
sudo fdisk /dev/mmcblk1<br />
This will take you into the ‘fdisk’ application.</p>
<p>Type the following in order:</p>
<p>1<br />
2<br />
3<br />
4<br />
n<br />
p<br />
1<br />
8192<br />
If you now execute:</p>
<p>1<br />
sudo fdisk -l<br />
you will see your new partition (notice that it’s the name of the drive with “p1″ added to the end, this will be different on the non-arm devices….), but now we need to put a file system onto it..</p>
<p>Execute the following command to install an ext4 filesystem:</p>
<p>1<br />
sudo mke2fs -t ext4 /dev/mmcblk1p1<br />
Eject your card</p>
<p>Re-insert it</p>
<p>Done…. Your card now has a working ext4 filesystem and we’re ready to install crouton onto it..</p>
<p>OK, at this point, you have a working SD Card</p>
<p>OR if you’re installing internally, **this is where you join back in with the instructions***</p>
<p>We’re back to the basics of crouton now…</p>
<p>First, download the script (for the most up to date download, go here: https://github.com/dnschneid/crouton – at the top of the page, you will see a link like http://goo.gl……. I’m not posting it here as it changes regularly, and these instructions need to stay up to date…)</p>
<p>Make sure before you download it that you delete any previous versions of the script that you might have (just in case you use an old one)..</p>
<p>Back in a shell, once the script is downloaded, execute:</p>
<p>FOR SD CARD PEOPLE::</p>
<p>1<br />
sudo sh -e ~/Downloads/crouton -t xfce -p /media/removable/External\ Drive<br />
(careful with this location – if you’re familiar with linux use your “tab” key to complete the location, it’s easier and always accurate…)</p>
<p>OR FOR INTERNAL DRIVE INSTALL::</p>
<p>1<br />
sudo sh -e ~/Downloads/crouton -t xfce<br />
Wait for the process to complete..Answer any prompts (like your name, and password)</p>
<p>Now, to launch into your new desktop, the commands are:</p>
<p>FOR SD CARD USERS</p>
<p>With SD card inserted, open a crosh window -&gt; ctrl+alt+t<br />
Enter the shell by typing “shell”<br />
Type</p>
<p>1<br />
2<br />
cd /media/removable/External\ Drive/bin<br />
sudo bash startxfce4 -c /media/removable/External\ Drive/chroots/<br />
FOR INTERNAL INSTALLS</p>
<p>1<br />
sudo startxfce4<br />
Then to switch between the two desktops, just use the following key combo:</p>
<p>CTRL + ALT + SHIFT + “Back”</p>
<p>Enjoy!!</p>
