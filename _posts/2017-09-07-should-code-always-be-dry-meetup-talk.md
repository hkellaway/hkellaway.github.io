Check it out! I presented a Meetup talk for Brooklyn Swift Developers entitled "Should Code Always Be DRY?": [View here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/16FCAGbIYOUyuCCu7riBnLYrDxI_TVbcR/view?usp=sharing)

It's based on my blog post, [Writing Imperfect Code](/blog/2017/09/06/writing-imperfect-code) on lessons learned from trying to be perfectionistic in real-world application development such as:

* Do Repeat Yourself
* Use MVC
* Create Inflexible Interfaces
* Do Not Refactor
* Donâ€™t Cherish Good Code
* Cherish Legacy Code

Thanks to Etsy for hosting and to Brooklyn Swift Developers for having me!
