<p>Unwind segues are a great way to get from one view controller down the stack back up to another. However, implementing them is not so straight forward - I always forget myself, so I thought I'd share it here.</p>

<p>The key is to first add a method onto the view control <em>to which</em> you're segue-ing that takes in a <em>UIStoryboardSegue</em>. For example:</p>

<blockquote>
@interface ViewController<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- (IBAction)unwindFromMarketplaceView:(UIStoryboardSegue *)segue;<br />
@end
</blockquote>

<p>Afterwards, head to Storyboard and ctrl+drag from the yellow Home icon on the top of the view your <em>segueing from</em> to its green Exit icon. This will create an unwind segue in Storyboard. Click that segue and give it an identifier.</p>

<p>To programmatically enact the segue - say when a button is touched, you can then call <em>[self performSegueWithIdenfifier:(NSString)unwindSegueIdentifier sender:self]</em> in the view controller that is being transitioned to.<p>

<p>Happy coding!</p>
