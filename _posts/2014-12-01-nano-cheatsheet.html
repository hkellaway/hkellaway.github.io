If you're like me, then you like to use nano for simple editing tasks when working with Terminal. I've been using nano for a year now and I really enjoy it - but I still occasionally forget commands. I Googled for a good cheatsheet but didn't find any - so here I made one. <a href="/documents/nano_cheatsheet.pdf">Here you go</a> !
