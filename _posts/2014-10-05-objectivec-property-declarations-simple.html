As a developer who's taken a steep dive into Objective-C just this year, I'd have to say one of the very confusing idiosyncracies of the language that had me confused is the declaration of properties. Specifically - when is a property `weak` or `strong`. When is something `nonatomic` versus `retain`. Why am I thinking about these things in the first place.

They say that the best way to learn something is to tech others. So to help both you and myself, I'd like to explain what's going on here as simply as I can.
