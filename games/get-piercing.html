<h2>Get Piercing - iOS game</h2>

{% include app-store-badge-get-piercing.html %}

<p><em>Get Piercing</em> is a ridiculous and gory infinite scroller game for iOS. It was created with <a href="http://byjor.com" target="_blank">Jordan Arnesen</a> for the Cardinal Game Jam 2014 and published to the App Store January 2015.</p>

<p>Description:<br /><em>You're in charge of the piercing parlor - make sure all of your customers get pierced as quickly as possible! Let too many customers leave the shop without all of their piercings and you're fired. This silly and slightly gory infinite scroller is perfect for piercing enthusiasts.</em>
